		<h2>Our Mission</h2><br />
		<p>I intend to develop myself in a positive manner and avoid anything that would reduce my mental growth or 
		physical health. I intend to develop self-discipline in order to bring out the best in myself and others. 
		I intend to use what I learn in class constructively and defensively, to help my fellow man and myself, 
		and to never be abusive or offensive. I am a student of Taekwondo.</p>

		<h2>About FHMA</h2><br />
		<p>It is never too early or too late to begin learning martial arts at Fountain Hills Martial Arts.
		Master Smith will provide exercises and advice based on personal attention to each individual's needs.
		In each class, Master Smith will lead the group in many different training activities depending on experience, age and belt degree.
		This allows anyone, regardless of experience, to begin learning martial arts easily in regular classes.
		Students may choose from attending only Taekwondo sessions, only learn combat oriented martial arts, or to attend all classes to become a complete martial artist.</p>
